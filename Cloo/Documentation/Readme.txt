[Description]
Cloo is an object oriented, OpenCL wrapper. Written in C#, it takes advantage of the .NET framework to provide portability and ease of use while exposing the full functionality of the OpenCL platform.

[Requirements]
The following is required for Cloo to work properly:
1) OpenCL drivers. If not preinstalled, you can obtain them from your graphics card manufacturer website or operating system vendor website.
2) Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or an equivalent alternative (Mono).
3) The EXPERIMENTAL version of the OpenTK library. For more info refer to: http://www.opentk.com/

[Download]
You can download the most recent version of Cloo from: "http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloo/"

[Notes]
Currently, there is no support for object sharing and data transfers between OpenCL and OpenGL.
