[Description]
Cloo is an open source, easy to use, managed library which enables .NET/Mono applications to take full advantage of the OpenCL framework.

[Requirements]
The following is required for Cloo to work properly:
1) OpenCL drivers. Depending on your system, you can obtain them from your graphics card manufacturer website or operating system vendor website.
2) The Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or an equivalent alternative (Mono).
3) The EXPERIMENTAL version of the OpenTK library. For more info refer to "http://www.opentk.com/".

[Download]
You can download the most recent version of Cloo from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloo/".

[Help]
You can use the forums at "http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloo/forums" to contact the developers.

[Notes]
Currently, there is no support for object sharing and data transfers between OpenCL and OpenGL.
