[0.5.1] -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Breaking changes:
ComputeJobQueue renamed to ComputeCommandQueue. Avoids confusion for new users.
All ComputeEvent properties that included "Job" in their names are renamed as well.
AddBarrier(), AddMarker() and WaitFor() of ComputeCommandQueue renamed to Barrier(), Marker() and Wait() respectively.

New functionality:
None.

New overloads/helpers:
GetByName() and GetByVendor() methods in ComputePlatform.

Inner changes:
Extension queries modified in order to give an empty list of tokens instead of a list containing one empty token in case no extensions are supported.
OpenTK raw bindings are now included with Cloo. There is no more dependency on OpenTK.dll.

Bugfixes:
Enumeration of devices of an OpenCL platform.
Fixed bug that prevented creation of ComputeContext on ATI Stream 1.0 final in 64bit OS's.
